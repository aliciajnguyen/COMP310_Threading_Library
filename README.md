# COMP310 Threading Library
A basic user-level threading library developed for an assignment in an operating systems course, with the capacity to create threads, perform tasks and switch between threads. A scheduler also includes two kernel level threads as executors as kernel level threads, one for computing tasks and one dedicated for I/O tasks to avoid interrupt delays.

Functions are documented in the sut.h header file in src.
Queue.c only provides a basic implementation of a queue.
